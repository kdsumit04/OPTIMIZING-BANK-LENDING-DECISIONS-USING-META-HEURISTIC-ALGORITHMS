# OPTIMIZING-BANK-LENDING-DECISIONS-USING-META-HEURISTIC-ALGORITHMS

Problem Statement:
For the given requirements of the customers we had to find that which selected customers should the bank give loan such that bank makes a profit
Work Done:
Developed a meta-heuristic model to maximize bank’s profit by optimizing it’s lending decisions in a credit crunch . Designed and implemented an amalgamated model using the concepts of Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing . Reduced the overall loan screening time in range of 36%-50% as compared to the Traditional Linear Programming Method
